Problem Statement: Predictive Model for Real-World Data
Build a machine learning model that predicts an outcome using a real or public
dataset.
Scenario
Given a dataset (crop yield, sales, energy usage, or health metrics),build a model to predict a future value and explain the results.


1. Problem Understanding 

Agriculture plays a vital role in ensuring food security, supporting rural livelihoods, and contributing significantly to economic growth. In many countries, especially developing nations, a large portion of the population depends on agriculture as their primary source of income. Therefore, improving agricultural productivity is essential for sustainable development.

Crop yield is influenced by various environmental and management factors such as rainfall, temperature, soil quality, humidity, fertilizer usage, pesticide application, and land area. Variations in these factors can lead to fluctuations in agricultural output, which may affect food supply and market stability. Traditional methods of yield estimation often rely on experience and manual analysis, which may not always provide accurate or timely results.

This project aims to build a machine learning–based predictive model that estimates crop yield using historical agricultural and climatic data. By analyzing past records and identifying hidden patterns, the model can learn the relationship between input features and crop productivity. The proposed system utilizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

Accurate crop yield prediction helps farmers in making informed decisions regarding crop selection, irrigation planning, and fertilizer management. It also assists policymakers and agricultural organizations in planning storage, distribution, and pricing strategies. By adopting data-driven approaches, this project contributes to the development of smart and sustainable agricultural practices.

2. Dataset Description

The dataset contains 50,000 records with 10 attributes.

Features include:

Region

Crop Type

Rainfall

Temperature

Humidity

Soil pH

Fertilizer Usage

Pesticide Usage

Area

Target:

Crop Yield (tons per hectare)

3. Data Preprocessing

Checked missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Normalized numerical features

Split data into training and testing sets (80:20)

StandardScaler was used for feature scaling.

4. Model Pipeline

Two models were implemented:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Pipeline:
Data → Preprocessing → Training → Evaluation → Prediction

Random Forest was selected as the final model due to better performance.

5. Results and Evaluation

Evaluation Metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

R² Score

Random Forest achieved better accuracy and lower error compared to Linear Regression.

Graphs of actual vs predicted values were plotted for visualization.

6. Inference and Explanation

Feature importance analysis showed that:

Rainfall

Temperature

Fertilizer usage

were major factors affecting crop yield.

Higher rainfall and proper fertilizer usage improved productivity, while extreme soil pH reduced yield.

The model learns nonlinear relationships between environmental factors and yield.

7. Conclusion

This project successfully built a predictive model for crop yield estimation.
Random Forest provided reliable predictions.

Future improvements include using real-time weather data and deep learning models.
